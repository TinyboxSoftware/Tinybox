# Backend Starter

initalize this with [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) - Sanity.io is my prefered CMS starter.

To initialize a new sanity instance,

1. install sanity globally `npm install -g @sanity/cli`
2. initialize a new sanity instance with `sanity init`
3. follow the prompts through the cli then hook it up to the frontend
