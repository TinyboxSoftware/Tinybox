I used to work at VSSL Full time, as an e-commerce developer. When I made the decision to go off on my own with Tinybox we continued to work together.

I worked heavily on their Shopify store, with implemented features ranging from a range of bespoke landing pages, to geo-location popups, email templates, to heavy performance improvements on the store.

## Features

- Bespoke landing pages ranging from email waitlists, to product showcases.
- Geo-location popups to redirect users to the correct site.
- Dynamic cart that responds to add-to-cart actions and shows discounts.
- Heavily improved site speed and site performance.

## Testimonial

> Fantastic service and a great guy. We recommend Tinybox to anyone who needs a Shopify website or web services. We'll be working together for any further web-based services we require! Mykal will deliver exactly what you want, thanks for all your hard work!
