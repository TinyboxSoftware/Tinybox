## Summary

The founder of AND Architectural, Angela Dhillon, approached me about helping her put together a website to help build brand credibility for her business in the eyes of clients and prospective partners.

We worked together on a tight timeline, with a small scope. The result was a high quality landing page for her business that's fully configurable by her via a content management system with a 2-week turn around.

## Deliverables

- Completely configurable site via the [Sanity.io content management system](https://sanity.io) (CMS)
- Contact form that goes directly to the business email.
- Website analytics and monitoring services via Fathom analytics.
- Brand development and ideation.

## Testimonial

> It was an absolute pleasure working with Mykal on my company website. He was extremely professional and very quick to respond. He was great at listening to my ideas but contributed both a creative and technical element to the design process that took my website to the next level. I will definitely work with him again on projects moving forward
