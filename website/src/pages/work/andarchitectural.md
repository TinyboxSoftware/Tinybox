Angela from AND Architectural approached us about putting together a website to help build band credibility for her business to clients and prospective partners.

We worked together on building a high quality site with a small scope. The result was a high quality landing page for her business that's fully configurable by her and her time via a content management system.

## Features

- Fully editable site via the Sanity.io content management system (CMS)
- This is another feature

## Testimonial

> It was an absolute pleasure working with Mykal on my company website. He was extremely professional and very quick to respond. He was great at listening to my ideas but contributed both a creative and technical element to the design process that took my website to the next level. I will definitely work with him again on projects moving forward
