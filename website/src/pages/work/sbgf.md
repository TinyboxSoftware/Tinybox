While I was working with SaraBella's early, this project ramped up right around when COVID-19 shut retail down. SaraBella's needed a way to keep their heavily in-person business (a comfy gluten-free café) thriving.

The solution we came up with was a custom, mobile-optimized, e-commerce store that made it easy for customers to order items for covid-safe pickup.

## Key Deliverables

- Comprehensive website design and implementation
- Fully editable content via the [Shopify](https://shopify.com) admin interface.
- Custom drink ordering system for in-store pickup.
- Custom kitchen management system for managing incoming drink orders.
- Website analytics via Google analytics and Shopify reports.

## Testimonial

> We are so happy with Mykal's work! He made us a beautiful new website and online store, checking in frequently to make sure we liked the direction he was taking everything. He has been super accommodating of our last-minute requests and changes. We're so glad we switched to Tinybox!
