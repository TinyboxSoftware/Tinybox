The SaraBella's Gluten Free cafe website (sarabellasgf.com) was an interesting project. This project was started right around when COVID-19 was starting and was heavily inspired by the need for an e-commerce solution to keep their business thriving. 

The solution we came up with was a custom, mobile-optimized e-commerce store that made it easy for customers to order items for pickup.
