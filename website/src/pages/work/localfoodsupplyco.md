## Summary

Local Food Supply Co. and I worked together on a bunch of fun, interactive pieces of their site. I was really excited to work with the team and they had a tonne of solid ideas we were able to exeucte on.

### Recipe blog templates

We built a custom blog template for recipes that was optimized for mobile and desktop readers, and up-selling customers on recipe ingredients sold by the store.

The idea being that by offering high-quality, aspirational content that highlights the potential of the stores product, we could land more sales, while also encouraging customers to have fun with some of the client's favorite foods from their store.

### Bundle product templates

Another fun piece of tech we were able to put on the site was an interactive "bundle" product page. These pages were awesome for highlighting a bunch of products that go well together, or for things like gift baskets.

Users could pick and choose which items in the bundle they'd like to include, which means that even if the bundle is a bit pricey, or they don't want a specific item they have the option to remove it from the cart.

## Key Features

- Custom blog page template that enables high quality recipe content.
- Custom product page template that enables bundling products together.
- Custom page editor solutions and general web consulting.
- Age gated pages for online alcohol sales.
- Performance improvements to the website.
- Free shipping progress bar from the cart.
