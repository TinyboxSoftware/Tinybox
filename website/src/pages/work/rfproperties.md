RF Properties approached me to build a website that showcased previous and upcoming real estate developments to prospective buyers and partners.

The real stand out piece for this project was the development landing pages. Each piece of property had it's own landing page with a slideshow of photos, an interactive map highlighting the neighborhood, a filterable list of all units, and a call-to-action that collected information from interested buyers.

## Key Deliverables

- From the ground up design and development of a purpose-built website.
- Fully customizable site via the [Sanity.io content management system](https://sanity.io) (CMS).
- Bespoke landing pages for each real estate development.
- Interactive map that showcased each development's neighborhood, amenities, and walkability.
- Interactive filtering and review features to highlight each individual unit's layout.
- Highly integrated forms that collected interested user's info per property, and passed it on to marketing teams.

## Testimonial

> We used Tinybox to create our website and we are very pleased with the process and results. Tinybox was professional to work with, prompt in their replies, and worked hard to cater the site to suit our needs. We highly recommend Tinybox and will use them again in the future.
