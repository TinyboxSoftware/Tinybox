Redekop Ferrario properties approached us to build a website that showcased previous developments, as well as upcoming developments to prospective buyers. The real stand out piece for this project was an interactive map on the page that highlighted the neighborhood.

## Features

- Bespoke landing pages for each development.
- Interactive map of each development's neighborhood and amenities.
- Full content management system via Sanity.io 

## Testimonial

> We used Tinybox to create our website and we are very pleased with the process and results. Tinybox was professional to work with, prompt in their replies, and worked hard to cater the site to suit our needs. We highly recommend Tinybox and will use them again in the future.
